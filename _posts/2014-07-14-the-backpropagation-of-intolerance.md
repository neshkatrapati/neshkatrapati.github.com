Intolerance is a very destructive thing in my opinion. 
Its limits the scope of understanding what/whom you are intolerant about. 
It breeds prejudice and cultivates a monotonic viewing angle. 
It often strips you of the faculty of reason with-respect-to that person or thing which is involved in your intolerance.

In my life, I observe that, others' intolerance affects me badly.
It makes me intolerant of the those who are intolerant.
It works like this, I expect people, to be tolerant in general ( simplistic you say ?. sure. ). 
Now, if a group/person is intolerant of someone/something, 
I become intolerant of them and, as I said just before, once somebody becomes intolerant, 
their expectation of the object of their intolerance becomes skewed. Hence, the title.
